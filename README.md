# Overview

BERT Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a project that performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of a given text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we focus on analyzing tweets and classifying them into different sentiment categories.
